- Use Archive::Any and Archive::Tar to get rid of the only XS module
  dependency (Compress::Zlib), or implement inflate algorithm in perl.

- Before that happens, tweak script/par.pl so it can write the Zlib.so
  (or Zlib.dll, etc) in the currently directly during a BEGIN block.

- Consequently, script/par.pl -O should take another flag that simply
  in-lines all required perl modules (PAR.pm, IO/Scalar.pm, etc -- but
  _not_ Config.pm), thus creating a stand-alone, cross-platform,
  self-contained archive which runs everywhere that has a Perl 5.6.

- Have another flag to cause it to inline standard lib/ modules, too.

- Also probe perlcc to see if it can compile in the standard libraries.

- Make a script/pl2par.pl that takes a script file, and then:
  - Scan 'use', 'require', 'do', 'use lib' and '(push|unshift) @INC'
  - Store them in temporary lib/ and $Config{arch}/ directories
  - Put the original script and associated scripts under script/
  - Generate a stub 'main.pl'
  - Archive them into a single .par file
  - Optionally turn it into a self-executing script -- that's Perl2exe.

- Overrides CORE::require to provide coexistence support for multiple
  versions of a module on the same machine.
