- Let static.c rename par.exe to whatever basename(argv[0]) is.

- Win32 T_VERSION support as --info, using Win32::EXE.

- Implement inflate algorithm in perl, xor implement Archive::Zip,
  Compress::Zlib and friends in C.

- Overrides @INC to provide coexistence support for multiple
  versions of a module on the same machine.  Or use Ingy's only.pm.

- Refactor pp to use App::Packer.

- caller() from pp'ed executable should return nothing, instead
  of the current calling stacks.  Currently there's a workaround
  as PAR_CLEARSTACK in myldr/main.c, but it segfaults and hence
  is commented out by default.

- make CHECK blocks work by perl_parse the code instead of
  eval"". this should clenaly solve the above problem as well.
