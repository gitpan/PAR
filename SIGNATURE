This file contains message digests of all files listed in MANIFEST,
signed via the Module::Signature module, version 0.14.

To verify the content in this distribution, first make sure you have
Module::Signature installed, then type:

    % cpansign -v

It would check each file's integrity, as well as the signature's
validity.  If "==> Signature verified OK! <==" is not displayed,
the distribution may already have been compromised, and you should
not run its Makefile.PL or Build.PL.
