This is the README file for PAR, a module to use perl scripts
and modules stored inside compressed .par files.

Please see the PAR.pm for typical uses, and script/par.pl for an
alternative perl packaging utility.

* Installation

PAR uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

After installation, if you want to enable stand-alone binary support,
please apply the included patch to the B::C module first (5.8.0 only):

patch `perl -MB::C -e'print $INC{"B/C.pm"}'` < patches/perl580.diff

And then:

perlcc -o /usr/local/bin/par script/par.pl
