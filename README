This is the README file for PAR, a module to use perl scripts
and modules stored inside compressed .par files.

Please see the PAR.pm for typical uses, script/par.pl for running
bundled perl distributions, and script/makepar.pl for generating
PAR files (aka PerlApp or Perl2exe).

There is also a presentation "Introduction to PAR", available on
the web as <http://www.autrijus.org/par-intro/slide001.html>.

* Installation

PAR uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

After installation, if you want to enable stand-alone binary support,
please apply the included patch to the B::C module first (5.8.0 only,
5.6.1 does not need this):

    % patch `perl -MB::C -e'print $INC{"B/C.pm"}'` < patches/perl580.diff

and then:

    % perlcc -o /usr/local/bin/par script/par.pl

Afterwards, you can generate self-executable binaries by:

    % makepar.pl -B -O./foo.par /home/test.pl
    % perlcc -o par.exe par.pl		# only need to do this once
    % par.exe -B -O./foo.exe foo.par	# self-contained .exe
    % foo.exe				# runs anywhere with same OS

If you want to make a self-contained script instead (without bundling
the perl binary and core modules), do this:

    % makepar.pl -S -B -O./foo.par /home/test.pl
    % par.pl -b -O./foo.pl foo.par	# or -B to bundle core modules
    % perl foo.pl			# runs anywhere with core modules
