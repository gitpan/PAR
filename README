This is the README file for PAR, a toolkit to use perl scripts
and modules stored inside compressed .par files.

Please see the PAR.pm for typical uses, script/pp for bundling
prerequisite modules of scripts into a PAR file (aka PerlApp or
Perl2exe), and script/par.pl for running/making self-contained
PAR executables.

There is also a presentation "Introduction to PAR", available on
the web as <http://www.autrijus.org/par-intro/slide001.html>.

* Installation

PAR uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If your system has a C compiler, the 'pp' tool and a stand-alone binary
version of par.pl will be compiled and installed automatically.
You can generate self-executable binaries by:

    % pp -o foo.exe /home/test.pl

If you want to make a self-contained script instead (without bundling
the perl binary and core modules), do this:

    % pp -p -o foo.par /home/test.pl
