This is the README file for PAR, a toolkit to use perl scripts
and modules stored inside compressed .par files.

Please see the PAR.pm for typical uses, script/makepar.pl for
bundling prerequisite modules of scripts into a PAR file (aka
PerlApp or Perl2exe), and script/par.pl for running/making
self-contained PAR executables.

There is also a presentation "Introduction to PAR", available on
the web as <http://www.autrijus.org/par-intro/slide001.html>.

* Installation

PAR uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If your system has a C compiler, the stand-alone binary version of
par.pl will be compiled and installed automatically.  You can generate
self-executable binaries by:

    % makepar.pl -B -O./foo.par /home/test.pl
    % par.exe -B -O./foo.exe foo.par	# self-contained .exe
    % foo.exe				# runs anywhere with same OS
					# (but see TODO for caveats)

If you want to make a self-contained script instead (without bundling
the perl binary and core modules), do this:

    % makepar.pl -S -B -O./foo.par /home/test.pl
    % par.pl -b -O./foo.pl foo.par	# or -B to bundle core modules
    % perl foo.pl			# runs anywhere with core modules
